<h1 style="font-family:gotham"> INTERESTS </h1>   
<h4 style="color:#622E4C;"> When it comes to design, I love seeing well thought-out color and flair, like that of pop-art and art-deco. I've been teaching myself to draw by hand more, so I love analyzing things like gesture and form in the context of design, combining two worlds that I love exploring. More than anything, my creative works are fueled by my love of discovery. Whether it's delving into skills like color theory or practicing challenges like perspective, I derive fulfillment from witnessing my own growth as an artist and person. There's a certain joy to simply pouring love into creating something, especially upon seeing that you're capable of more of it than you think.</h3>
